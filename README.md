We are creating a program that calculates the BMI(Body Mass Index) of a person.

It is a method of measuring to classify an individual into three different categories: 
- Under weight
- normal weight
- over weight

BMI < 18.5, You are underweight.
BMI 18.5 - 24.9, You are normal.
BMI > 24.9, You are overweight.
